# OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
  It is a paradigm of software development.

## Encapsulation
 - It's when you encapsulates data that are not important for who is using your method or class.
 - When you have a class called Car you use the Car.Engine.Start(). Doesn't matter how the engine starts because you just want to start it.

## Polymorphism
 - It's a way to do the same thing in different types of objects.
 - For example, the method Talk exposed on Animals class, a cat can say "Meow", a dog can say "Wolf" and so on.

 ## Inheritance
 - It's a way of reusing things that are in common in a type.
 - For example, a class called Animal can have some properties:
    NumberOfLegs, Name, Race
 - You can define some Actions/Properties that all animals have.
 
## Interface
 - It's a way to create contracts in programming languages.
 - Using interface you have to respect that contract, but also can change the implementation without changing the input/response.
 - It helps a lot to test your application because you can create your own mocks to represent the concrete implementation.

## Class
 - It is a way to represent an object of real life, the body of the object.

## Object
 - It is an instance of a class, it represents the concrete implementation thinking in the real world.

## Override
 - It's a way of rewrite a method using the same input/output.

## Overload
 - It's a way of creating many methods with the same name, just changing the input. 
 - For example, you can specify many parameters you want in differents methods with the same name.

## Abstract
 - It's a class that cannot be instantiated.
 - It's a good way of define base classes.

## Delegates
 - It's a way of defining the structure of functions.
 - It allows you to pass callbacks, defining a delegate.
