In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

# Design Patterns
 - Using design patterns help us to maintain, refactor and extend software.
 - They are final version, but templates that help us to solve specific problems.
 - They help Oriented Object Programming solve it's problems.
 - They help us to understand codes in the entire world. (We speak the same)

# Creational Design Patterns 
 - These design patterns are all about class instantiation.

## Singleton
 - One static reference in the entire project or process.
 - Used to share data between multi-threads.
 - Used when you need just one instance of a class or service.
 - Examples (Reports, Logs and Share data)
